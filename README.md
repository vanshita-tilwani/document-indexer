# Homework 2: Indexing, Term Positions

## Objective
Implement your own index that would replace the one from elasticsearch used in HW1, then index the document collection used in HW1. Your index should be able to handle large numbers of documents and terms without using excessive memory or disk I/O.

This assignment involves writing two programs:

1. Task 1 - A tokenizer 
2. Task 2 - indexer
    - Index Compression (MS students only)

3. Task3: Searching
    - Proximity Search (MS students only)

### NOTES  

1. An updated version of your HW1 ranker which uses your inverted index

2. You have some flexibility in the choice of algorithms and file formats for this assignment. You are expected to to explain and justify your approach, any reasonable approach should work.
